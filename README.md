# Installation

## Elastic Search

### Linux

Worked for me out of the box. I.e., just downloaded the binaries from http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/elkdownloads/.

### OSX

1. Download and Install the JRE *and* *JDK* from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads (Get the `.dmg`)

2. brew update & brew install elasticsearch
