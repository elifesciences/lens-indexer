- filtered queries
  - filter -> score: fuzzy-and'ing?
  - highlighting and filtering?

- total number articles for a query
  - [ok] comes with every query on 'articles' index

- total number of fragments per article
  - ATM number of fragments goes into score
  - Can these be counted?

- global facets:
  - queried once per session to fill facet browsing UI
    {
        "aggs" : {
            "genders" : {
                "terms" : { "field" : "gender" }
            }
        }
    }

  - can facets be ranked? E.g. the 100 most relevant authors
    ... By default, the terms aggregation will return the buckets for the top ten terms ordered by the doc_count. One can change this default behaviour by setting the size parameter.
    http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html#_size

- result facets:
  - number of facets within result (e.g. 215 Bio-Chemistry)

  - maybe combine query and aggregations?
